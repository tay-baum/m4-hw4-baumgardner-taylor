                <h2>JUDAH</h2>
                    <p>In 2020, the band's lead vocalist and guitarist, Judah Akers, began releasing solo music under the artist name JUDAH.</p>
                    <p>JUDAH is the surgacing of a compelling and raw journey expressed through shouts of praise and tumultuous reflection. Not only does he have story to tell but has been gifted with an honest ability to connect with people through music. The hope for JUDAH is to scream out Christ's love to followers and doubters alike, and share the real grace and redemption that's been found by someone walking in their shoes.</p>
                    <p>JUDAH is unapologetically authentic and straighforward, ripping through the layers of stigma and discomfort. He comes with a fresh approach that reflects his personality and style of praise and worship through music.</p>
